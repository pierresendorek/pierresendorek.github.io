<h2>Re-drum</h2>
<br>

<h3>Outline</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">
This algorithm converts a pattern of vocal imitation of drums to the same musical pattern but with the vocal sounds replaced by samples of acoustic drums.

The algorithm <a href="https://github.com/pierresendorek/redrum.git">Github/redrum</a> takes the sound contained in <tt>in.wav</tt> as an input  
as well as a dictionary that provides the mapping between the vocal imitation of drums to the target acoustic drum sounds, and yields the sound <tt>out.wav</tt><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Principle</h3>

<p style="text-align:left;">
For each peak detected in <tt>in.wav</tt>, the spectral features of a segment of 100ms following the peak are extracted and compared to the spectral features of the example sounds which are the keys of the dictionary.
The features at each peak are associated to the most similar features of example sound (which is itself a vocal imitation of drums) from the keys of the dictionary.<br>
Finally <tt>out.wav</tt> is made by placing the corresponding acoustic drum sample at the peak, for each peak.

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p style="text-align:left;">The result is far from being perfect, but can be improved by providing more training samples to the algorithm.</p>
